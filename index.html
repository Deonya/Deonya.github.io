    <h1>Computer Science Capstone</h1>
    <h2>Introduction and Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>My journey in computer science has been one of continuous learning, growth, and perseverance. I began my studies with a strong curiosity about how software systems function, and over time, I developed a deep appreciation for problem-solving, efficiency, and user-centered design. Throughout my academic career, I have worked with various programming languages, algorithms, and database technologies, which have shaped my ability to develop scalable and efficient applications. Through my concentration in information security, I've had the privilege of learning fundamental IT skills such as networking, cybersecurity, and data analysis.

        One of the most valuable lessons I have learned is the importance of adaptability. Technology is always evolving, and being able to transition between different programming paradigms, frameworks, and problem-solving techniques is essential. My ability to migrate a mobile application to a web-based platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript demonstrates my capacity to apply my skills in different environments. Additionally, implementing a more efficient sorting algorithm—Merge Sort—into my project has enhanced my understanding of data structures and algorithmic efficiency.

        Another major aspect of my learning experience has been working with databases. Initially, my projects relied on static file processing, but transitioning to a JSON server has helped me explore dynamic data management and improve my understanding of backend technologies. This enhancement has made my project more practical and scalable, ensuring that it can handle real-world data scenarios more effectively.

        This capstone project represents the culmination of my studies, showcasing my ability to design, develop, and enhance software solutions. Through these enhancements, I have demonstrated my proficiency in software engineering, algorithms, and database management. My goal is to continue refining my skills and applying them in a professional setting, where I can contribute to creating efficient and user-friendly software solutions.
